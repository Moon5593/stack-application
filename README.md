# Stack application
Before running this application, make changes to firebase.
After that to run the app just hit npm install. After npm install run command 'ionic serve'.

Note - The first time network connection is mandatory because this application uses 'Network' plugin. Hence, when there is no network, state of application gets automatically adjusted and hence modal is shown with appropriate state of an application.
Also, few things like comments images are under construction.
